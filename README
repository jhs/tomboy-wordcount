Overview
========

This is a Tomboy plugin (addin) which will count the lines, words, and
characters in a note, much like the Unix "wc" tool.

Installation
============

Most users can run "make install".  If you have Tomboy installed in a
non-standard location, then you will need to source the env.sh script:

  $ source env.sh

Please edit the script first and configure the prefix so that it will
know where to find tomboy.

Usage
=====

Enable the plugin in the Tomboy preferences, and then open a note.
Next, click the "Tools" button and select "Word count".  (Alternatively
you can press Ctrl-O.)  Congratulations!  Now you know how many lines,
words, and characters are in your note.

Please see the TODO file for a list of current bugs and features.
